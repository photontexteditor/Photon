# Photon
![Photon](https://github.com/photontexteditor/Photon/blob/main/img/photon.jpg)
Photon `Photon Text Editor` is a modern text editor with minimalist features using an object-oriented paradigm. It is a minimal text editor that empowers users with features such as writing source code for multiple programming languages, copy, cut, find, replace, word count, and user control user interface as basic features.

## Features
Photon is developed using [`python`](https://www.python.org/) and its robust [libraries and frameworks](#moduleslibraries). The development process involved designing an intuitive modern user interface, integrating advanced text editing and code editing functionalities, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. 

Some of the features of Photon Text Editor are:-
1. Basic features include copy, cut, paste, find, and replace functionalities.
2. Intermediate features include text wrap (char and word wrap), word counter, character counter, line counter, column counter, and automatic text/code recognition.
3. Advanced features include translation (ne), text-to-speech (en), multiple programming language code editing functionality, line wrap.
4. Cross-platform availability (Windows, Linux, and macOS).
5. Modern Graphical User Interface (GUI).
6. Compiler support (for C and C++) and Interpreter support (for Python and Java)

## Programming Language:
Photon is developed using [`python`](https://www.python.org) (OOPs Paradigm).

## Outcome
Photon aims to enhance productivity for programmers, writers, and professionals alike. Through the development of this text editor, the project tries to provide a comprehensive solution to the limitations faced by traditional text editors, fostering enhanced user experiences and efficient content management. Photon text editor holds the potential to impact the text editing landscape significantly and could greatly benefit from continuous user feedback and collaborative contributions. To make GUI using python, there are various other libraries like [tkinter.ttk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html), [ttkbootstrap](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PyQT](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt), [PySide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PySide), [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/index.html), etc.
